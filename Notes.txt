why build stuff that is already in the browser? NProgress, Link etc.

GraphQL is a spec lang agnostic spec

client can be anything (ex. arduino)

graphql can replace REST or sit in front of REST to proxy data.

Can implement in any lang.
BE: prisma, graphql yoga
FE: Apollo

graphql single endpoint, send query, get data
it is a typed language

graphql datamodel = database schema, duplication?
relationship? umm like a RDMS?

query/mutation

graphql does not have filtering, sorting?!!

graphql itself does not fetch, filter and sort data
just a way to describe what you want.

servers implement RESOLVERS , they answer how and where get the data from..That's where you handle filtering sorting etc.

just a standard to request specific data.

graphql syntax: learning another data definition language..

graphql is db agnostic

prisma exposes datetime fields (lastcreated, lastupdated) => tied to prisma implementation now.


directives in graphql: confusion for angular devs, implemented by your graphql server(prisma). => tied more to prisma.

prisma deploy: database migrations, dacpac, oSetupSQL
